Documentation and tools to support a JSON format for the storage and
distribution of conlangs (Constructed Languages).  This is designed
initially for use with the ConlangSpeak program but is being created
and distributed as a separate project to facilitate its usage as part
of other programs and platforms.

Documentation, including the LaTeX source for generating it, can be found
in the doc directory.

Several Python tools for working with Conlangs saved in this JSON format can
be found in the python_tools directory.

A GUI tool for editing a conlang in this JSON format can be found in the gui_editor
directory.
